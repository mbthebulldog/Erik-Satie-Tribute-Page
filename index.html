                    <li>Éric Alfred Leslie Satie was an highly-laudable front-runner of the Parisien avant-garde in the early 1900s. Refusing the title of <em>musician</em>, Satie insisted he was instead a <em>phonometrician</em>—“one who measures sound”.</li>

                    <li>Satie’s grandest contributions to the musical world were perhaps his <a href=“https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S-Xm7s9eGxU” target=“_blank”><em>Gymnopédies</em></a>, which certainly merit a good few hundred listens.</li>

                    <li>He was also a prolific writer, contributing much to the Dadaist movement. In his early career, he was fond of pseudonyms, using such flowery noms de plume as Francois de Paule and Virginie Lebeau.</li>

                    <li>He also lived at one time in Montmartre, which is a fun name to try to pronounce and also historically a veritable hotbed of fascinating thinkers and creators in Paris. You should probably travel to there, buddy. I’ve been there. It’s nice.</li>
                    
                    <li>Satie died a vainglorious death, ascribed largely to his voluminous appetite for absinthe. This ascription is weighted by tremendous cirrhosis of his liver discovered after his death. His legacy is a small plaque denoting a modest grass patch front an apartment building as the “Parc Erik Satie”.</li>

                    <li>Ten out of ten dentists with very good taste in classical music recommend checking out Satie’s <a href=“http://www.classical-music.com/article/six-best-satie-works”>music in more detail</a> or <a href=“https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Satie”>reading about his life</a>.</li>
